# CAST MY SHOW

Cast My Show is a small side project I created for quickly and easily casting theatre productions using a drag and drop interface. It lets users create accounts, search for a show (or, add a new show if it doesn't exist already), cast it, and save their casts for later!

## Motivation

The main goal of the project was to learn how to work with Firebase, but I also had a great time working on the drag and drop interface, accessibility for various components, and the search functionality.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/gdgkirkley/castmyfriends

npm start

## Built With

- ReactJS
