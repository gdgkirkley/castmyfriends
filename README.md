# CAST MY SHOW

Cast My Show is a small side project I created for quickly and easily casting theatre productions using a drag and drop interface. Users create accounts, search for shows (or, add a new show if it doesn't exist already), cast a show, and save their casts for later!

## Motivation

The main goal of the project was to learn how to work with Firebase, but I also had a great time working on the drag and drop interface, accessibility for various components, and the search functionality.

Since creating the project, I've also taken Kent C. Dodds' <i>Testing Javascript<i> and am now using that knowledge to [add tests for the entire project.](./src/__tests__)
