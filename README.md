# CAST MY SHOW

Cast My Show is a small side project for quickly and easily casting theatre productions using a drag and drop interface. It lets users log in, search for a show from the database, add a new show if it doesn't exist already, cast a show, and save their casts!

The main goal of the project was to learn how to work with Firebase, but I also had a great time working on the drag and drop interface, accessibility for various components, and the search functionality.
